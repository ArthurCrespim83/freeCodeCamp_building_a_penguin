üêß Building a Penguin: A purely HTML and CSS project demonstrating the creation of a charming penguin illustration. This project focuses on advanced CSS techniques to build complex shapes and animations without relying on JavaScript or external image assets.

üåü Project Overview: This "Building a Penguin" application is a creative exercise in front-end development, showcasing the power of CSS for intricate graphical rendering. It meticulously constructs a detailed penguin figure, complete with environmental elements like mountains and a sun, entirely through HTML structure and CSS styling. The project highlights the versatility of CSS properties for shape manipulation, gradients, and subtle animations.

üí° Features: Pure CSS Illustration: Penguin, mountains, and sun are entirely rendered using HTML and CSS, Complex CSS Shapes: Utilizes border-radius, transform (skew, rotate), and pseudo-elements (::before) to create organic shapes, CSS Gradients: Employs linear-gradient for realistic background and element shading., Interactive Element: The penguin scales up on click (:active state), demonstrating basic CSS interactivity., CSS Animation: Includes a subtle wave animation for the penguin's arm., Responsive Base: Designed with a viewport meta tag and relative units for adaptability.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used: HTML5 for the structural elements of the illustration & CSS for all styling, shaping, positioning, and animation.
